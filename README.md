# Manifest Repo

This repo includes manifests of all my open-source projects:
- [qemu-linux-riscv](https://github.com/SimonSungm/qemu-linux-riscv) : a combination of projects to develop and test QEMU, OpenSBI and Linux kernel for RISC-V.


## Quick Start
Projects are managed by [gerrit git-repo](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/). Therefore it is necessary to install repo on your machine. To install repo, you can refer to the git-repo project on [Google git]((https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/)) or use [Tsinghua Open Source Mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/git-repo/).
